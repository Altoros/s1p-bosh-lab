### Prepare Deployment of Nginx Manifest

(Taken from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cloudfoundry-community/nginx-release/master/manifests/nginx_ubuntu_centos.yml)

***SSH into jumpbox***
```
gcloud compute --project "project-name" ssh --zone "region" "machinename"
```
***switch to ubuntu user***
```
sudo su - ubuntu
```

***We need to create a development environment for our manifest.***
```
mkdir -p ~/workspace/nginx && cd ~/workspace/nginx
```
***Now we need to prepare a deployment manifest.***
```
touch nginx.yml
```

The deployment manifest is a `.yml` file that defines the components and properties of the deployment. When an engineer initiates a new deployment using the CLI, the Director receives a version of the deployment manifest and creates a new deployment using this manifest.

[Deployment identification](https://bosh.io/docs/deployment-manifest.html#deployment)
  ```
  ---
  name: nginx

  ```
  Note, that in our case this block don't contain `director_uuid` parameter, because we are creating environment and don't have BOSH Director installed yet.

[Releases block](https://bosh.io/docs/deployment-manifest.html#releases)
  ```
  releases:
  - name: nginx
    version: latest
  ```
  This section contains information about the releases, that we are going to use in the deployment. As you can see we are installing the latest `nginx` release. A Cloud Provider Interface (CPI) is an API that the Director uses to interact with an IaaS. A CPI abstracts infrastructure differences from the rest of BOSH. Note, that we are using our precompiled releases here, to speed up deployment.

[Stemcells](https://bosh.io/docs/deployment-manifest.html#releases)
```
stemcells:
- alias: centos
  os: centos-7
  version: latest
- alias: ubuntu
  os: ubuntu-xenial
  version: latest
```
This section contains information about the stemcells, that we are going to use for our images in the deployment. As you can see we are using the latest `centos` and `ubuntu` stemcells.  BOSH produces official stemcells for popular operating systems and infrastructures. For infrastructures that support it, light stemcells are a more efficient way to reference stemcells that we have pre-uploaded and shared within the IaaS.

[Instance Groups ](hhttps://bosh.cloudfoundry.org/docs/terminology/#instance-group)
  ```
  instance_groups:
  ```
  Here we define instance groups which is a collection of  instances tasked to perform same jobs. Each instance group has an associated VM type, persistent disk type, a stemcell and a set of jobs. Instance groups are configured in the deployment manifest.

[Instance Information](https://bosh.io/docs/deployment-manifest.html#disk-pools)  
***name:*** Specifies the name of the instance group.  
***instances:*** Specifies the number instances in the environment.  
***azs:*** Specifies the Availability Zones the instances will use. Which is defined in your cloud config.  
***vm_type:*** Specifies the VM types available to deployments. Which is defined in your cloud config.  
***stemcell:*** Specifies the stemcell name that will be used for the instance. The stemcell is either picked automatically based on the OS name and version provided.  
***networks:*** Specifies the network available to deployments. Which is defined in your cloud config.
```
- name: nginx-centos
 instances: 1
 azs: [ z1 ]
 vm_type: nginx-small
 stemcell: centos
 networks:
 - name: nginx
```

***Jobs:*** Define a list of release jobs required to be run on an instance group. Each instance group must be backed by the software from one or more BOSH releases.  
***name:*** Defines the name of the current job.  
***Properties:*** Define the properties that the release job requires, as defined by the release job in its specification file. Regardless of what properties are set in the manifest, they will be injected into the jobâ€™s machine only if they are defined in the specification file.
```
   jobs:
   - name: nginx

        fi
```

[Update Block](https://bosh.io/docs/deployment-manifest/#update):   contains canaries and is important for production environments. Canary instances are instances that are updated before other instances. We can use them as fail-fast mechanism, because any update error in a canary instance will terminate the deployment.
```
update:
  canaries: 1
  max_in_flight: 1
  serial: false
  canary_watch_time: 1000-60000
  update_watch_time: 1000-60000
```
